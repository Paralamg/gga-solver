# Global Gradient Algorithm (GGA)

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Global Gradient Algorithm (GGA) 
for solving hydraulic pipe networks. The method was developed by E.Todini. 
This project is designed primarily for educational purposes to help students of hydraulics 
and oil and gas engineering

## Theory
The theory and the report on teaching practice can be found in the [file](REPORT%20ON%20TEACHING%20PRACTICE.pdf).

The [file](REPORT%20ON%20TEACHING%20PRACTICE.pdf) is in Russian :)

## Usage
1. Create python environment 
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
2. Activate environment
```bash
# Mac/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate  
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install dependencies
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the example
```python
python main.py
```
